## New Technologies Used
- Sass
- Fetch
- Webpack

## Description

This project asked us to work off of someone elseâ€™s code. It was our first experience with a large amount of refactoring. We used several technologies and concepts that were new to us at the beginning of the project. The new technologies are listed above. The new concepts included using class inheritance for JavaScript, and following best practices for user accessibility.

## Issues Fixed
- Creation of parent class UserData: A new parent class contains shared methods across the Hydration, Sleep, User-repo, and Activity classes.
- SCSS refactor: existing CSS data has been cleaned up and enhanced with Sassy CSS. SCSS files were broken into logical file organizations as well. 
- Use of Fetch: All data is retrieved via web APIs, as well as posted to them to update the existing database with user input.
- Accessibility improvements: Updating the existing HTML and styling, user accessibility Lighthouse score is at 100%. Contrast ratios were improved and labels added to assist with screen reader technologies, as well as the user being able to logically tab through the page. All colors are colorblind friendly. 
- Data Error Checking: Set up conditionals to catch data that did not match the correct format, so as not to interrupt the user display. 
- Data Validation: Wrote JS code to prevent users from entering wrong data in the input fields.
